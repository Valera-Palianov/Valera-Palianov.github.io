					<h3>Nightwish - Shoemaker</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Descriptions</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Eugene Shoemaker was a geologist and a founder of modern planetary science. He studied craters on Earth and Moon, and realized that they were created by asteroid impacts. Shoemaker was the geology principal investigator for Apollo missions, and he also helped to train the Apollo astronauts that went to the Moon. He himself was a candidate for an Apollo Moon flight but was disqualified after being diagnosed with Addison's disease. Later in life, he said, "Not going to the Moon and banging on it with my own hammer has been the biggest disappointment in life."
							</p>
							<p>
								Shoemaker spent much of his later years searching for undiscovered impact craters around the world. He died on July 18, 1997, in a car accident in Australia, where he was studying craters. In 1999, as a recognition for his scientific accomplishments, some of his ashes were carried to the Moon by the Lunar Prospector space probe. His final resting place is close to the lunar south pole, in the Shoemaker crater, named after him.

					<h3>Evanescence - Bring Me To Life</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Descriptions</h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								The track was written by group members Amy Lee, Ben Moody, and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features uncredited guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. "Bring Me to Life" is a nu metal, rap rock, hard rock and alternative rock song. According to Lee, "Bring Me to Life" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler.
